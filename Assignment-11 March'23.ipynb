    "Using the same critical value (e.g., Z-value for a 95% confidence interval) for both samples, you will find that the margin of error for Sample 2 (larger sample size) is smaller compared to Sample 1 (smaller sample size). This is because the larger sample size provides more precise information about the population mean, resulting in a narrower confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",

    "Purpose: The GET method is primarily used to request data from a specified resource on a web server. It is a \"safe\" and \"idempotent\" method, meaning it should not have any side effects on the server, and multiple identical requests should produce the same result.\n",
    "Usage: GET requests are typically used for retrieving data, such as web pages, images, or other resources, from a server. When you enter a URL into your web browser and hit Enter, it sends a GET request to the server to fetch and display the requested web page."

    "Usage: POST requests are commonly used for operations that create, update, or delete data on the server, such as submitting forms, uploading files, or making API calls that modify server-side data.\n",
    "Parameters: Data is typically sent in the request body, not visible in the URL. This makes POST suitable for sending sensitive or large amounts of data. Data can be formatted in various ways, such as JSON, form data, or XML."

    "Ans-In Flask, the request object is used to access incoming data and information about an HTTP request made to a web application. It provides access to various components of an HTTP request, such as headers, form data, query parameters, and more. Here's why the request object is used in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Data: The request object allows you to access data sent by the client as part of the HTTP request. This includes data from HTML forms, query parameters from the URL, and data sent in the request body.\n",

    "Form Data: When a user submits an HTML form on a web page, the form data is typically sent to the server in the body of an HTTP request. Flask's request object provides methods to easily access and process this form data.\n",

    "File Uploads: When handling file uploads, such as images or documents, the request object allows you to access the uploaded files and process them as needed.\n",

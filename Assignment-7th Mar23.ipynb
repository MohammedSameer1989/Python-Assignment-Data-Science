    "Covariance is not standardized and depends on the units of the variables being measured. As a result, the magnitude of covariance can vary widely depending on the scale of the variables.

    "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. A positive covariance indicates that when one variable is above its mean, the other tends to be above its mean as well, and vice versa. A negative covariance indicates the opposite relationship. However, the magnitude of covariance does not provide information about the strength or direction of the relationship.\n",
    "Correlation quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between variables. A correlation of 1 (or -1) indicates a perfect positive (or negative) linear relationship, while a correlation of 0 indicates no linear relationship.

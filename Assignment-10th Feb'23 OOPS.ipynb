    "Ans-The close() function (or method) is used to close a file that has been opened for reading, writing, or any other file operations. It's essential to close a file properly for several important reasons:\n",
    "1.Resource Management: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain resources to manage that open file, such as file handles, memory buffers, and other system resources. If you don't close the file, these resources may not be released until the program terminates, potentially leading to resource leaks and decreased system performance.\n",
    "2.Data Integrity: If you're writing data to a file, not closing it properly can result in incomplete or corrupted files. Data may be buffered in memory, waiting to be written to the file, and if the file isn't closed, this data may not be flushed to the file. Closing the file ensures that all data is written and that the file's state is properly updated.\n",
    "3.File Locking: Some operating systems and file systems impose restrictions on concurrent access to files. If you don't close a file after writing to it, other processes or programs may be unable to access or modify it until it's closed, which can lead to unexpected issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.File Deletion or Renaming: In some cases, you may want to delete or rename a file after you're done with it. If the file is still open, many operating systems won't allow you to perform these actions, resulting in errors or unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Avoiding Data Loss: If you're reading data from a file, failing to close it can potentially lead to data loss if the file is modified or deleted by another process while it's still open.    \n"

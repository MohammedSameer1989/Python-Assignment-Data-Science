    "Ans-Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single Python process. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process, and multithreading allows you to run multiple threads simultaneously, which can be particularly useful for tasks that can be executed independently and concurrently."

    "SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model: SQL databases, also known as relational databases, use a structured, tabular data model. Data is organized into tables with predefined schemas, where each table consists of rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases enforce a strict schema, which means that the structure of the data (e.g., column names and data types) is defined in advance, and any data that doesn't conform to this schema is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Properties: SQL databases adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which guarantee data integrity and consistency, making them suitable for applications where data accuracy is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as the standard query language for data manipulation and retrieval. SQL provides a powerful and expressive syntax for working with structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, which means that you can increase their capacity by upgrading hardware (e.g., adding more CPU, RAM, or storage to a single server)."

    "\n",
    "Data Model: NoSQL databases employ various data models, including document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph models. These models allow for more flexible and unstructured data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: NoSQL databases are often schema-less or schema-flexible, meaning that data within the same database can have different structures. This flexibility makes it easier to adapt to changing data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID vs. BASE: NoSQL databases often prioritize performance and scalability over strict ACID compliance. They use the BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) model, which may trade off some consistency for improved availability and partition tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: While some NoSQL databases offer their query languages (e.g., MongoDB's query language), others may not have a standardized query language, and queries are performed using APIs or specific programming libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are typically designed to be horizontally scalable, which means they can distribute data across multiple servers or nodes to handle high volumes of traffic and data."

    "Ans-In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program. When an exceptional condition is encountered, Python generates an exception object that represents the error. This exception can then be caught and handled by the program, allowing it to respond to errors gracefully rather than crashing\n",
    "1.Exception Types: Exceptions in Python come in various types, each representing a specific error or exceptional condition. Common exception types include TypeError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError, ZeroDivisionError, and IndexError, among others.\n",
    "2.Exception Handling: To handle exceptions, you use try and except blocks. Code that might raise an exception is placed inside the try block, and if an exception occurs, the program jumps to the corresponding except block to handle the exception.\n",
    "3.Exception Hierarchy: Exceptions in Python are organized into a hierarchy, with the base class BaseException at the top. More specific exceptions inherit from this base class, allowing you to catch different types of exceptions based on your needs.    "

    "##What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It refers to the concept of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors while hiding the unnecessary details. In other words, abstraction allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, making the system more manageable and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by concrete subclasses. Interfaces, on the other hand, define a contract that classes must adhere to by implementing all the methods declared in the interface."

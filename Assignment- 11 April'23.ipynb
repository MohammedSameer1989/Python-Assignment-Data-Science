    "Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble technique used in machine learning to improve the stability and accuracy of models, especially in situations where the training data is limited or prone to overfitting.

    "Bootstrap Sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging starts by creating multiple random subsets (samples) of the original training dataset through a process called bootstrap sampling.

This means that some data points may be duplicated in the subsets, while others may not appear at all.\n",

By training multiple models on different parts of the dataset and then combining their predictions, bagging aims to create an ensemble model that is more robust and less sensitive to fluctuations or noise in the data.\n",
